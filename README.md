## âš¡ Me Myself and I âš¡

Hello my followers, as you know my name is JoÃ£o Aguiar, I work as Application Support Engineer and a im still a student at the University of Porto. With a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering already under my belt, I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Network Engineering and Computer Systems. 

I enjoy solving problems, learning new technologies and designing software applications. Iâ€™m a quick learner with a fun and outgoing personality who is interested in pursuing more knowledge in Web Development and IT Security.
