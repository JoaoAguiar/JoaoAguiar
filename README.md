##  ðŸ¤Œ Everything You Wanted to Know About JoÃ£o Aguiar (But Were Too Afraid to Ask) ðŸ¤Œ

Hello my followers, as you know my name is JoÃ£o Aguiar, AKA the computer wizard who spends his days crushing tech bugs as an Application Support Engineer, while juggling the life of a student at the University of Porto. I already have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering, and I'm currently chasing down a WWE Championship, with Rey Mysterio as my sidekick, and a Master's in Network Engineering and Computer Systems, because why not add a few more hours of homework to my already packed schedule? 

I have a strange addiction to problem-solving, kind of like how some people can't resist to pizza. When I'm not busy cracking my brain over tough challenges, you can usually find me, or not, looking at the latest technology. I've been told I have a personality that's as fun as a barrel of monkeys (although, I'm not entirely sure what that means) and I'm always up for a good time. My insatiable thirst for knowledge in Web Development and IT Security is like a bottomless pit, except instead of food, it's information that I'm consuming. So, bring on the challenges and let's get learning!
